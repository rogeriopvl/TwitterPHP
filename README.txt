TwitterPHP is a complete Object-Oriented PHP library

improve it and what not.

--------------------------------------------------
How to use TwitterPHP?
--------------------------------------------------

1- Extract the content of the zip file to a directory
of you choice. If you're placing TwitterPHP on a 
webserver, it should be placed in a directory that the
webserver can access.

2- Edit the config.inc.php file and insert the twitter
username and password of the account you wich to access
twitter with. Please note that you should be sure that
this file can't be read by others, or you'll be
compromising your twitter account.

3- Now start coding with it. You can check the
documentation at <http://rogeriopvl.com/twitterphp>
or at the zip file in the doc folder.
